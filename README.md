# Task2
SIMPLE BLOG APPLICATION
Create a frontend to display blog posts, with pages for viewing,
creating, editing, and deleting posts. Set up a backend to
handle API requests and manage data. Use a database like
MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store blog posts.
It is a delightful experience of developing a fullstack solution assesing my skills.
